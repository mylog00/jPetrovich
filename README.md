==========

jPetrovich is library which inflects Russian names to given grammatical case. It supports first names, last names and middle names inflections.

jPetrovich is Java implementation of [Petrovich](https://github.com/petrovich/petrovich-ruby) ruby gem.

P.S. Most code was ported from [NPetrovich](https://github.com/petrovich/petrovich-net).
But maybe I rewrite it better. And now we have what we have.

## Installation

Just reference jPetrovich jar to your project.
You also need to copy `rules.yml` to folder with jar or specify the path.
